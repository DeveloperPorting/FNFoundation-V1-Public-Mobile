# Contributing Info
Anything more than a bugfix/QoL change will not be accepted. We are not looking for contributions that add/remove/modify the content of the mod in any way.

# Building
This only covers Windows, for Linux and others you have to figure it out yourself.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> THIS ENGINE DOES NOT SUPPORT WEB OR MOBILE AND THERE ARE NO PLANS TO SUPPORT EITHER OF THEM

## Prerequisites
- Install [Haxe 4.2.0](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.0/)
- Install [VS Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), and download "MSVC v143". You might need Windows 10/11 SDK, but I'm not sure.

## Libraries
Go into the "setup" folder and double click the `compile.bat` file, all the necessary libraries should install automatically, and the mod should launch after building.

# Special Thanks
